#Step 3: Create Views for CRUD Operations
# View Implementation:
# Using Django REST Frameworkâ€™s viewsets, set up CRUD operations for both posts and comments in posts/views.py.
# Implement permissions to ensure users can only edit or delete their own posts and comments.
#I want to create a custom permission that will allow me to determine who can make changes and who cannot

        serializer.save(author=self.request.user)
    filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter]
    search_fields = ['title', 'content']
class CommentViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):

    queryset = Comment.objects.all()
    def perform_create(self, serializer):
        #here, I want to influence what the serializer can do. I want it to save the author directly
        #here, I have added additional context to ensure I am getting the exact post. I am saying from request.data. get the post_id

Step 5: Implement Pagination and Filtering
Enhance API Usability:
Add pagination to post and comment list endpoints to manage large datasets.
Implement filtering capabilities in post views to allow users to search posts by title or content.

"""
Step 3: Implement the Feed Functionality
Feed Generation:
Create a view in the posts app that generates a feed based on the posts from users that the current user follows.
This view should return posts ordered by creation date, showing the most recent posts at the top.
